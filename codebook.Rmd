# Project Description
This project uses data from Human Activity Recognition using SmartPhones, A full description is available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) where the data was obtained: 

Data used for this project can be found in: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

# What data is used

Data from the following files are used for calculating the average for each measurement
variable for each activity and each subject

* features.txt
    + Describes the various measurement variables.
* activity_labels.txt
    + Describes the activity labels, values in this file are used to map values read from y_train.txt and y_test.txt to the corresponding activity.
* Training dataset
    + subject_train.txt (subject Id)
    + x_train.txt (measurement of various variables)
    + y_train.txt (what activity does the measurement correspond to?)
* Test dataset
    + subject_test.txt (subject Id)
    + x_test.txt (measurement of various variables)
    + y_test.txt (what activity does the measurement correspond to?)

# Description of the variables in the tidy.txt file

tidy.txt can be read as data frame in R, here is a quick summary of the data. 

```
>dim(dataMean) <-- Assume tidy.txt is read as df into dataMean
[1] 180  68
```

* subject - The ID of the test subject
* activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
* Other columns represent the average for a particular measurement variable (mean/std) based on specific activity and subject.

Activity Labels section defines what the activities are.

## Activity Labels

* WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
* STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
* LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
