# Getting And Cleaning Data
This README corresponds to the project for Getting And Cleaning Data course.
The project demonstrates how to get, clean and convert data such that they
adhere to the tidy data principles.

# Project Requirement

Script the following steps in run_analysis.R

* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final result of running the script is generation of tidy.txt. More information of what the data and script used to analyse this data can be found in codebook.md.
